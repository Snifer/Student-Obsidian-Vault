Hello, 

I will participate with a demo vault for students either school or university I think it could be used in both cases in [Obsidian October](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/Obsidian+October+2022)

The objective was to create a vault as simple and accessible as possible, that's why it handles a simple task control and data logging, we plan to make this vault modular and add other functionalities over time. 

We avoided integrating many plugins or functionality such as Templater, Obsidian Database Folder or GTD Plugin for example, in order not to complicate the main use of the vault. 

Use PARA method for organizate the vault and content management, with posibility. 

Currently I generate spanish content about Obsidian on my [Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/sniferl4bs), previously created a note system based on Zettelkasten and the workflow of Ruben Loan. [Sistema de Notas - Zettelkasten (Obsidian Template)](https://snifer.gumroad.com/l/ylwkc)

- All callouts can be collapsed for maintain clean Dashboard 
- The registration of information is performed from the dashboard in the respective areas.
- The trash is configured to send to the **.trash** folder to Obsidian to prevent deletions due to errors. 
- User Wikilinks to reference notes. 


>[!NOTE]
>If you are just starting out and want to learn more about Obsidian you have the https://forum.obsidian.md and https://help.obsidian.md.
